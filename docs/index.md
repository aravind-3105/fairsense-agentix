# FairSense-AgentiX

**An agentic fairness and AI-risk analysis platform developed by the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).**

---

## What is FairSense-AgentiX?

FairSense-AgentiX is an intelligent bias detection and risk assessment platform that uses **agentic AI workflows** to analyze text, images, and datasets for fairness concerns. Unlike traditional ML classifiers that operate as black boxes, FairSense employs a reasoning agent that:

- **Plans** its analysis strategy based on the input type
- **Selects** the right tools for each task (OCR, vision models, embeddings, knowledge retrieval)
- **Critiques** its own outputs and refines them iteratively
- **Explains** its reasoning process through detailed telemetry

This approach delivers more accurate, transparent, and context-aware fairness assessments than static rule-based systems.

## Key Features

### 🤖 Agentic Reasoning
Built on [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), FairSense-AgentiX implements a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loop** that:

- Dynamically selects analysis tools based on input characteristics
- Iteratively refines outputs using an evaluator-critique cycle
- Provides full transparency into decision-making via event streaming

### 🔍 Multi-Modal Analysis
Supports three analysis workflows:

- **Text Bias Detection** - Identifies gender, racial, age, disability, and socioeconomic biases in text
- **Image Bias Detection** - Analyzes visual content for stereotypes and representation issues using vision-language models
- **Risk Assessment** - Evaluates ML deployment scenarios for fairness, security, and compliance risks

### 🛠️ Flexible Tool Ecosystem
FairSense intelligently orchestrates a suite of specialized tools:

- **OCR Tools** (Tesseract, PaddleOCR) for text extraction
- **Vision-Language Models** (BLIP, BLIP-2) for image understanding
- **Embedding Models** for semantic search
- **FAISS Vector Databases** for knowledge retrieval
- **LLMs** (GPT-4, Claude) for reasoning and synthesis

### 🌐 Production-Ready APIs
- **FastAPI REST API** for programmatic access
- **WebSocket streaming** for real-time agent telemetry
- **React UI** with landing page, demo examples, and live timeline visualization
- **Batch processing** for large-scale analysis jobs

### ⚙️ Highly Configurable
Fine-tune every aspect of the system:

- Swap LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom)
- Choose OCR/vision model backends
- Enable/disable refinement loops
- Customize evaluation thresholds
- Override tool selection strategies

## How It Works

FairSense implements a **multi-node agentic workflow**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Plan]
    B --> C[Tool Selection]
    C --> D[Tool Execution]
    D --> E[Evidence Synthesis]
    E --> F[Evaluation]
    F --> G{Pass?}
    G -->|No| H[Refine Plan]
    H --> C
    G -->|Yes| I[Output]
```

1. **Planning** - Agent analyzes input and creates an action plan
2. **Tool Selection** - Chooses appropriate tools (OCR, VLM, embeddings, etc.)
3. **Execution** - Runs selected tools in parallel when possible
4. **Synthesis** - Combines evidence from multiple sources
5. **Evaluation** - Critiques output quality (completeness, accuracy)
6. **Refinement** - Iteratively improves results based on critique (optional but recommended)

This **critique-driven refinement loop** distinguishes FairSense from static pipelines, enabling it to handle edge cases and improve output quality dynamically.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VectorInstitute/fairsense-agentix.git
cd fairsense-agentix

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate

# Configure API keys (see Configuration section)
# Create .env file with your settings (see getting_started.md)
```

### Your First Analysis

```python
from fairsense_agentix import FairSense

# Initialize the engine
engine = FairSense()

# Analyze text for bias
result = engine.analyze_text(
    "We're looking for a young, energetic developer to join our startup team."
)

print(f"Overall: {result.summary}")
print(f"Found {len(result.bias_instances)} bias instances")
for instance in result.bias_instances:
    print(f"  - {instance['type']} ({instance['severity']}): {instance['text_span']}")
```

### Using the Web Interface

The easiest way to get started is with the integrated web interface:

```python
# Launch both backend and frontend
from fairsense_agentix import server
server.start()
```

Or use an example script:
```bash
python examples/launch_server.py
```

This starts:
- **Backend API** at `http://localhost:8000`
- **React UI** at `http://localhost:5173`

The UI has two pages:

- **Landing page** (`/`) — introduces the platform with a hero section, background gradient, and three analysis mode cards (Bias Text, Bias Image, Risk). Click any card to jump directly into that mode.
- **Analysis app** (`/analyze`) — select a mode from the tab bar, then paste text, upload an image, or describe an AI deployment scenario. Each mode includes **clickable demo examples** in the right column to pre-fill inputs instantly. Results show a live agent timeline on the left and structured output on the right.

Risk results link to the [MIT AI Risk Repository](https://airisk.mit.edu/) and display relevance scores (0–1) with category labels from the repository's Domain Taxonomy.
